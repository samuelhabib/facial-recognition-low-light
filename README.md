# facial-recognition-low-light
Welcome to the facial-recognition-low-light repository! This Python implementation is tailored for robust facial recognition in challenging low-light conditions, employing a hybrid methodology that seamlessly integrates traditional image processing, Haar Cascade, MobileNetSSD, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques.

## Overview:
This repository introduces a comprehensive Python implementation for facial recognition in low-light conditions. The hybrid approach fuses time-tested image processing methods with cutting-edge technologies like Haar Cascade, MobileNetSSD, and CNN. The project is meticulously designed to elevate facial recognition accuracy under the constraints of challenging lighting scenarios.

## Key Features:

### Modular Structure: 
The codebase exhibits a well-organized structure across three essential files:

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Manages image preprocessing using OpenCV, ensuring standardized and high-quality data.
- `facial_recognition.py`: Implements a facial recognition system with TensorFlow, incorporating Haar Cascade, MobileNetSSD, and CNN for robust feature extraction.
- `main.py`: Functions as the primary application file, featuring a simple command-line interface for straightforward testing.

### Hybrid Methodology: 
This project pioneers a hybrid methodology, skillfully merging established image processing techniques with the prowess of deep learning via Haar Cascade, MobileNetSSD, and CNN. This synergistic approach significantly enhances facial recognition accuracy in low-light scenarios.
