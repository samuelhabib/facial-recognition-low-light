# facial-recognition-low-light
Welcome to the facial-recognition-low-light repository! This project is a Python implementation designed for facial recognition in challenging low-light conditions, integrating traditional image processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches.


# Facial Recognition in Low-Light Conditions
## Overview:
This repository presents a Python implementation for facial recognition in low-light conditions, employing a hybrid approach that seamlessly integrates traditional image processing and advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques. The project is designed to enhance facial recognition accuracy under challenging lighting scenarios.

## Key Features:

## Modular Structure: The codebase is organized into three key files:

- data_preprocessing.py: Manages image preprocessing using OpenCV, ensuring standardized and high-quality data.
facial_recognition.py: Implements a facial recognition system with TensorFlow, leveraging a pre-trained CNN for robust feature extraction.
- main.py: Serves as the main application file, showcasing a simple command-line interface for easy testing.
  
## Hybrid Methodology: 
The project adopts a hybrid methodology, combining well-established image processing techniques with the power of deep learning through a CNN. This synergistic approach significantly improves facial recognition accuracy in low-light scenarios.
